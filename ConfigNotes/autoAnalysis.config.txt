########## Used by Both ###########

# HCI link/ staging directory
	# GNomExAutoAnalysis creates Analysis dirs in each Experiment Request, soft links in the paired fastq files, and then soft links each directory into this job staging directory.
	# The ChpcAutoAnalysis daemon on CHPC will be searching this directory for Analysis jobs with a RUNME file (but no COMPLETE file) to copy over and submit to the redwood cluster. 
	# The GNomExAutoAnalysis scans these soft linked directories for a COMPLETE file and then deletes the soft link leaving the finished dir in the Experiment Request.
